---

The RECOMB conference series was founded in 1997 to provide a scientific forum for theoretical advances in computational biology and their applications in molecular biology and medicine. The conference solicits research contributions from all areas of computational molecular biology. Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include:

- Molecular sequence analysis
- Recognition of genes and regulatory elements
- Molecular evolution
- Gene expression
- Biological networks
- Sequencing and genotyping techniques
- Genomics
- Population genetics
- Systems biology
- Imaging
- Computational proteomics
- Molecular structural biology

The origins of the conference came from the mathematical and computational side of the field, and there remains a focus on computational advances. In addition, the effective use of computational techniques in biological discovery is also an important aspect of the conference.
