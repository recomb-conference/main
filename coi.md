A conflict-of-interest (COI) is any obligation incurred by
members of the program committee that might influence, or
be construed to have influenced, their decision.  Because it is
both an internal matter -- we want each PC member to be making
an impartial judgment -- and an external one -- we do not want
anyone to think that PC members might have been influenced in
their decision, the decision of what constitutes a COI cannot
be left entirely to each individual.

This policy describes situations that constitute a definite COI
(real or perceived); PC members are responsible for declaring
such conflicts immediately (by using EasyChair to declare themselves
in conflict -- no reason need be given).  In addition, PC members are
encouraged to declare a COI in situations not listed below, but
in which they feel it might be difficult for them to remain impartial.
Finally, PC co-chairs are to take COIs even more seriously, if possible,
than other PC members, as they have final say over the disposition of
each submission. In particular, if one co-chair submits a paper, the other
co-chair will handle this in a way that reviewers are not disclosed to the
author, i.e. outside the regular EasyChair pipeline.


You have a COI with:
   1.  Your PhD and postdoc advisor(s), your PhD students, and your
    postdocs.  This conflict is lifelong "until death (or retirement)
    do us part".
   
   2.  With members of your family, your partner and partner's family, and
    other love interests.  However, you do not automatically inherit
    their own COIs.
   

3.  With close personal friends.  Here again, you do not automatically
    inherit your close friends' COIs.
4.  With anyone whom you have reason to believe may be somewhat hostile to you
    and with anyone towards whom you are somewhat hostile; also with
    anyone with whom you are currently in competition for a position.
5.  With anyone at your current institution or company, at an institution or
    company where you worked (as a salaried employee) at some point in the
    last 4 years, or at an institution or company where you are applying
    for a position.
6.  With anyone at an institution or company that has paid you some type
    of wages (e.g., consulting fees, sabbatical supplementary salary, etc.)
    over the last 4 years or that is currently retaining you as a consultant
    or in another paid capacity.
    (Honoraria for giving a research talk do not count, nor do
    in-kind benefits such as paid transportation and accommodations for
    visitors.)
7.  With any current research collaborator (with whom you have an ongoing
    project), any prospective collaborator (with whom you are writing a
    research proposal, for instance), and with anyone with whom you have
    collaborated in the last 4 years.

These constitute the minimum collection of COIs.  You may have additional
COIs that you are best placed to evaluate in the light of the list
above and keeping in mind that the question should be, not just "can I
remain impartial?" (actual COI), but also "Will others agree that my
impartiality would not be compromised?" (perceived COI).

On the other hand you do not automatically have a COI just because
  -   you are working on the same problem as the authors
  -   you had dinner with some of the authors at last year's conference
    (i.e., before you were invited to serve on this year's PC) and they
    paid for the meal
  -  you both served this year on the same panel or on the PC of another
    conference
  -  your high-school sweetheart is married to one of the authors
  -  you recently visited the authors' institution, gave a talk, and met with
    some people in their group (and perhaps even received an academic
    honorarium for your talk)
  - you both applied for the same job last year (but that search is over)
  - you have (or had) a common collaborator over the last 4 years, but on
    different projects
  - you would rather not socialize with the authors
  - you got your PhD from the same lab as one of the authors 10 years ago
  - etc.

If you have doubts, please discuss the issue with the PC chairs.
