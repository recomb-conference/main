RECOMB Satellite Conference Series was founded by Pavel Pevzner in 2001. Today, it consists of focused meetings covering various specialized aspects of bioinformatics.



##### RECOMB-Seq: RECOMB Satellite Conference on Biological Sequence Analysis

RECOMB-seq was founded in 2011 as a response to the expanding applications of high-throughput sequencing as a tool of basic science and biomedicine. The conference gathered leading researchers in computational genomics and genomic biology to discuss emerging frontiers in algorithm development for sequencing data. The emphasis is on applying computational approaches to improve analysis, interpretation and data management. Since then, the scope of RECOMB-seq has expanded beyond sequencing data to include assembled data as well, all the while focusing on methodological developments.

##### RECOMB-CCB: RECOMB Satellite Conference on Computational Cancer Biology

This workshop brings together leading researchers in the mathematical, computational, and life sciences to discuss emerging frontiers in computational cancer research. Advent of exciting technologies such as single-cell multi-omics,  spatial sequencing, and digital pathology opens new horizons for the analysis of tumor tissues. New analysis tools reveal novel aspects of cancer complexity, including the tumor mutational and phenotypic landscape, evolutionary history, or interactions with the microenvironment. The emphasis of all contributed work will be on applying algorithmic, mathematical, and statistical approaches to improve our understanding of cancer and on the development of useful, effective, and efficient new methods in this area.

- Steering Committee: Benjamin Raphael

##### RECOMB-CG: RECOMB Satellite Conference on Comparative Genomics

The RECOMB-CG satellite conference brings together leading researchers in the mathematical, computational and life sciences to discuss cutting edge research in comparative genomics, with an emphasis on computational approaches and novel experimental results. The program includes invited speakers, contributed talks and poster sessions.

Contributions to the conference are welcomed on any theoretical and/or empirical approach to genome-wide comparison. Topics of interest include genome evolution, population genomics, genome rearrangements, genomic variation, diversity and dynamics, phylogenomics, comparative tools for genome assembly, comparison of functional networks, gene identification or annotation, cancer evolutionary genomics, comparative epigenomics, paleogenomics, phylodynamics and related areas. We encourage submissions that offer new biological findings or otherwise highlight their relevance to biology.

- Steering Committee: Marília Braga, Dannie Durand, Jens Lagergren, Aoife McLysaght, Luay Nakhleh, David Sankoff


##### RECOMB-CG: RECOMB Satellite Conference on Computational Methods in Genetics

RECOMB Satellite on Computational Methods in Genetics will focus on current research at the intersection of genetics, computer science, statistics, and related fields in gathering and analyzing SNP and haplotype data and applying it to problems in medicine and basic research. Population genetics allows more refined understanding of the demographic history of our species, association analysis provides insights regarding the functional and molecular underpinnings of diseases and traits, while clinical applications suggest genetics as a trailblazer into personalized medicine. The complex bioinformatic questions arising range from inferring more nuanced statistical models of genetic information to algorithms that overcome the complexity challenges of analyzing millions of SNPs across millions of individuals, to systems level challenges of handling such Big Data repositories of genotypes and phenotypes.



##### RECOMB-BE: RECOMB Satellite Conference on Bioinformatics Education

RECOMB-BE focuses on bioinformatics education for undergraduate and graduate students, with a special emphasis on innovations in online learning, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rapid advances in the life sciences and in related information technologies necessitate the ongoing refinement of bioinformatics education, training, and learning strategies in order to maintain their relevance and to enhance their effectiveness. In response to this need, RECOMB-BE addresses best practices in teaching bioinformatics and computational biology.
